Humans are capable of continuously manipulating a wide variety of deformable objects into complex shapes. This is made possible by our intuitive understanding of material properties and mechanics of the object that allow us to reason about object states even when visual perception is occluded. These capabilities allow us to perform diverse tasks ranging from cooking with dough to expressing ourselves with potterymaking. However, developing robot systems to robustly perform similar tasks remains challenging, as current methods struggle to effectively model volumetric deformable objects and reason about the complex behavior they typically exhibit. To study the robot systems and algorithms capable of deforming volumetric objects, we introduce a novel robot task of continuously deforming clay on a pottery wheel. We propose a pipeline for perception and pottery skill-learning, called RoPotter, wherein we â€¦
