Disentangling two or more cables often requires many steps to remove crossings between and within cables. We formalize the problem of disentangling multiple cables and present an algorithm, Iterative Reduction Of Non-planar Multiple cAble kNots (IRON-MAN), that outputs robot actions to remove crossings from multi-cable knotted structures. IRON-MAN uses a learned perception system inspired by prior work in single-cable untying to imitate a graph-based supervisor, and operates on RGB image inputs of the workspace. Given a sequence of images as input, the system can disentangle two-cable twists, three-cable braids, and knots of two or three cables, such as overhand, square, carrick bend, sheet bend, crown, and fisherman’s knots. IRON-MAN keeps track of task-relevant keypoints corresponding to cable endpoints and crossings and iteratively disentangles the cables by identifying and undoing crossings …
