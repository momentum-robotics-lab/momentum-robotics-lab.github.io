Assisting surgeons with automation of surgical subtasks is challenging due to backlash, hysteresis, and variable tensioning in cable-driven robots. These issues are exacerbated as surgical instruments are changed during an operation. In this work, we propose a framework for automation of high- precision surgical subtasks by learning local, sample-efficient, accurate, closed-loop policies that use visual feedback instead of robot encoder estimates. This framework, which we call deep Intermittent Visual Servoing (IVS), switches to a learned visual servo policy for high-precision segments of repetitive surgical tasks while relying on a coarse open-loop policy for the segments where precision is not necessary. We train the policy using only 180 human demonstrations that are roughly 2 seconds each. Results on a da Vinci Research Kit suggest that combining the coarse policy with half a second of corrections from the â€¦
