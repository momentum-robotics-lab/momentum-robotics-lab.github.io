This paper investigates human instruction following for robotic manipulation via a hybrid, modular system with symbolic and connectionist elements. Symbolic methods build modular systems with semantic parsing and task planning modules for producing sequences of actions from natural language requests. Modern connectionist methods employ deep neural networks that learn visual and linguistic features for mapping inputs to a sequence of low-level actions, in an end-to-end fashion. The hybrid, modular system blends these two approaches to create a modular framework: it formulates instruction following as symbolic goal learning via deep neural networks followed by task planning via symbolic planners. Connectionist and symbolic modules are bridged with Planning Domain Definition Language. The vision-and-language learning network predicts its goal representation, which is sent to a planner for â€¦
