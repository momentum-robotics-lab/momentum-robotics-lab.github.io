Searching for objects in indoor organized environments such as homes or offices is part of our everyday activities. When looking for a desired object, we reason about the rooms and containers the object is likely to be in; the same type of container will have a different probability of containing the target depending on which room it is in. We also combine geometric and semantic information to infer what container is best to search, or what other objects are best to move, if the target object is hidden from view. We use a 3D scene graph representation to capture the hierarchical, semantic, and geometric aspects of this problem. To exploit this representation in a search process, we introduce Hierarchical Mechanical Search (HMS), a method that guides an agent’s actions towards finding a target object specified with a natural language description. HMS is based on a novel neural network architecture that uses neural …
