The main objective of this paper was to effectively interface object detection based on Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) with selective lossy image compression techniques to improve the efficiency of subsequent image operations and reduce the memory requirement for storing the images in autonomous applications of self-driving vehicles. Object detection and localization was performed using 2 state-of-the-art CNN based models from the Tensorflow 2.0 Object Detection API - Faster R-CNN ResNet152 V1    and CenterNet HourGlass104   . Lossy Image Compression centred around the most prominent detected object (which is preserved) is done through 3 techniques - K-Means Clustering (KM), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). The compressed and preserved parts were recombined to produce the final image. Analysis of the results obtained from different models â€¦
