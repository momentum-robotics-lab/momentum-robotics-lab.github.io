This paper explores a novel approach to dexterous manipulation, aimed at levels of speed, precision, robustness, and simplicity suitable for practical deployment. The enabling technology is a Direct-drive Hand (DDHand) comprising two fingers, two DOFs each, that exhibit high speed and a light touch. The test application is the dexterous manipulation of three small and irregular parts, moving them to a grasp suitable for a subsequent assembly operation, regardless of initial presentation. We employed four primitive behaviors that use ground contact as a “third finger”, prior to or during the grasp process: pushing, pivoting, toppling, and squeeze-grasping. In our experiments, each part was presented from 30 to 90 times randomly positioned in each stable pose. Success rates varied from 83% to 100%. The time to manipulate and grasp was 6.32 seconds on average, varying from 2.07 to 16 seconds. In some cases …
