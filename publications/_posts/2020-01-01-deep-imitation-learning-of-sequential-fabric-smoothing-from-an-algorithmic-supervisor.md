Sequential pulling policies to flatten and smooth fabrics have applications from surgery to manufacturing to home tasks such as bed making and folding clothes. Due to the complexity of fabric states and dynamics, we apply deep imitation learning to learn policies that, given color (RGB), depth (D), or combined color-depth (RGBD) images of a rectangular fabric sample, estimate pick points and pull vectors to spread the fabric to maximize coverage. To generate data, we develop a fabric simulator and an algorithmic supervisor that has access to complete state information. We train policies in simulation using domain randomization and dataset aggregation (DAgger) on three tiers of difficulty in the initial randomized configuration. We present results comparing five baseline policies to learned policies and report systematic comparisons of RGB vs D vs RGBD images as inputs. In simulation, learned policies achieve â€¦
