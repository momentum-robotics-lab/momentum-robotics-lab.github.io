with a hard real-time constraint. temporally correct Ti = (φi,pi,ei,Di) Page 3 Example Real-Time 
Motion Planning System Sense (eg, vision) Plan Move (controller) Tv Tp Tc Page 4 Problems

impossible. Page 6 Precompute Motion Plan Extremely popular option. • Allows arbitrarily 
long computation • Asymptotically feasible algorithms • Asymptotically optimal algorithms
