This report explores industrial electronics assembly application of tactile sensing with GelSight. A GelSight visionbased tactile sensor was attached to a parallel gripper and a 6 degree of freedom robot arm. Rudimentary in-hand pose estimation method of the grasped electronic components was proposed based on HSV thresholds. Then, a case study of electronics assembly tasks is presented. Based on the detected pose of the component, motion is planned to achieve desired rotation and translation with respect to the component frame. Then GelSight’s marker displacement vectors are considered to detect component’s fit with the PCB through-holes. Case study applications clearly showed that GelSight can provide useful tactile feedback for assembly tasks requiring precision and realtime pose estimation.
