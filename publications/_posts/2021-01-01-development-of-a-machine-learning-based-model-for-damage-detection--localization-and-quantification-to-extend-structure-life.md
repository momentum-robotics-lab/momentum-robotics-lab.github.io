Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has been researched for a long time and continues to be an active area of research. Initial work on SHM involved identification of hand-crafted features and predictive models relied on statistical methods. The recent improvements in computing capabilities, coupled with better integration of sensor data, has led to the emergence of more effective techniques in terms of scalability and predictive power. Machine learning offers a solution through automatic feature extraction algorithms, and scalable and noise robust models. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been used as state-of-art classifiers for images as well as for text. This paper proposes the use of the monitored structure’s transmissibility functions for the structure under observation, which can be fed into a novel composite architecture consisting of Deep CNN followed by multivariate linear regressors to detect …
