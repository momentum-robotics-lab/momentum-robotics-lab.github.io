Continuous product individualization and customization led to the advent of lot size one in production and ultimately to product-inherent uniqueness. As complexities in individualization and processes grow, production systems need to adapt to unique, product-inherent constraints by advancing production control beyond predictive, rigid schedules. While complex processes, production systems and production constraints are not a novelty per se, modern production control approaches fall short of simultaneously regarding the flexibility of complex job shops and product unique constraints imposed on production control. To close this gap, this paper develops a novel, data driven, artificial intelligence based production control approach for complex job shops. For this purpose, product-inherent constraints are resolved by restricting the solution space of the production control according to a prediction based decision â€¦
