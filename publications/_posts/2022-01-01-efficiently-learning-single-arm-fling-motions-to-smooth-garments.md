Recent work has shown that 2-arm" fling" motions can be effective for garment smoothing. We consider single-arm fling motions. Unlike 2-arm fling motions, which require little robot trajectory parameter tuning, single-arm fling motions are very sensitive to trajectory parameters. We consider a single 6-DOF robot arm that learns fling trajectories to achieve high garment coverage. Given a garment grasp point, the robot explores different parameterized fling trajectories in physical experiments. To improve learning efficiency, we propose a coarse-to-fine learning method that first uses a multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework to efficiently find a candidate fling action, which it then refines via a continuous optimization method. Further, we propose novel training and execution-time stopping criteria based on fling outcome uncertainty; the training-time stopping criterion increases data efficiency while the execution-time â€¦
