A four-dimensional tactile sensing system comprises a housing including a front-facing camera and at least one tactile sensor device positioned on the exterior surface of the housing, comprising an elastomer attached to a support plate a camera positioned proximate to the support plate, and opposite the elastomer, and at least one light source positioned proximate to the support plate and the camera, and opposite the elastomer. A four-dimensional tactile sensing device and tactile morphology method and algorithms are also disclosed.
