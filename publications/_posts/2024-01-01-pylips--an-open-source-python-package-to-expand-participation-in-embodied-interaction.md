 We demonstrate PyLips, a Python package for expanding access to screen-based facial interfaces for text-to-speech. PyLips can be used to rapidly develop social interactions for a wide variety of applications. We designed PyLips to be easy to use for novice users and expressive for experienced interaction designers. We demonstrate key features of PyLips: compatibility across devices, customizable face appearance, and automated lip synching for text inputs. PyLips can be found at https://github.com/interaction-lab/PyLips.
