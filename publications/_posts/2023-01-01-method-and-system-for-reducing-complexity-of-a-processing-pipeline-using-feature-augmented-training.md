A method and an electronic device for low-complexity in-loop filter inference using feature-augmented training are provided. The method includes combining spatial and spectral domain features, using spectral domain features for global feature extraction and signalling to the spatial stream during training, using a detachable spectral domain stream for differential complexity during training versus inference, and combining a unique set of losses resulting from multi-stream and multi-feature approaches to obtain an optimal output.
