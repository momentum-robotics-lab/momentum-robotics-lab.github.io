Methods and systems are provided for high-speed constrained motion planning. In one embodiment, a method includes computing, with a neural network trained on trajectories generated by a non-convex optimizer, a trajectory from one or more initial states of an autonomous system to one or more final states of the autonomous system, updating, with the non-convex optimizer, the trajectory according to kinematic limits and dynamic limits of the autonomous system to obtain a final trajectory, and automatically controlling the autonomous system from an initial state of the one or more initial states to a final state of the one or more final states according to the final trajectory. In this way, efficient and smooth trajectories can be rapidly computed for effective real-time control while accounting for obstacles and physical constraints of an autonomous system.
