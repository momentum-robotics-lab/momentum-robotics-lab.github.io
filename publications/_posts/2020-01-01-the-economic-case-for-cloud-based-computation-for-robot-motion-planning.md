Imagine a world in which robots are a part of everyday life, performing elegant and safe motions to accomplish complex tasks. To achieve this vision, robots will need access to extensive computational resources. Cloud-based computers have the potential to provide the needed computing power, while lowering robot cost, space, and energy requirements. Academia and industry are already exploring the cloud as a purveyor of data in a wide variety of applications, and have shown the benefit of the cloud for accelerating offline- and pre-computations.But what about interactive/online computation, as is often required by robot motion planning? This paper presents an economics-based argument that it is possible to extend a robot’s useful service life and battery-based operation time, improve its efficiency and profitability, and reduce its initial costs, by using the cloud in complex online and interactive computations …
