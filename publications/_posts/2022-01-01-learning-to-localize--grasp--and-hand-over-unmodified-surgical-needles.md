Robotic Surgical Assistants (RSAs) are commonly used to perform minimally invasive surgeries by expert surgeons. However, long procedures filled with tedious and repetitive tasks such as suturing can lead to surgeon fatigue, motivating the automation of suturing. As visual tracking of a thin reflective needle is extremely challenging, prior work has modified the needle with nonreflective contrasting paint. As a step towards automation of a suturing subtask without modifying the needle, we propose HOUSTON: Handover of Unmodified, Surgical, Tool-Obstructed Needles, a problem and algorithm that uses a learned active sensing policy with a stereo camera to iteratively localize and align the needle into a visible and accessible pose for the other gripper. To compensate for robot positioning and needle perception errors, the algorithm then executes a high-precision grasping motion that uses multiple cameras â€¦
