Robot haircare systems could provide a controlled and personalized environment that is respectful of an individual's sensitivities and may offer a comfortable experience. We argue that because of hair and hairstyles' often unique importance in defining and expressing an individual's identity, we should approach the development of assistive robot haircare systems carefully while considering various practical and ethical concerns and risks. In this work, we specifically list and discuss the consideration of hair type, expression of the individual's preferred identity, cost accessibility of the system, culturally-aware robot strategies, and the associated societal risks. Finally, we discuss the planned studies that will allow us to better understand and address the concerns and considerations we outlined in this work through interactions with both haircare experts and end-users. Through these practical and ethical considerations, this work seeks to systematically organize and provide guidance for the development of inclusive and ethical robot haircare systems.
