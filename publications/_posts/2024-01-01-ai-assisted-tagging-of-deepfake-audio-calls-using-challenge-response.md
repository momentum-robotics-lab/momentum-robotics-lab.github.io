Scammers are aggressively leveraging AI voice-cloning technology for social engineering attacks, a situation significantly worsened by the advent of audio Real-time Deepfakes (RTDFs). RTDFs can clone a target's voice in real-time over phone calls, making these interactions highly interactive and thus far more convincing. Our research confidently addresses the gap in the existing literature on deepfake detection, which has largely been ineffective against RTDF threats. We introduce a robust challenge-response-based method to detect deepfake audio calls, pioneering a comprehensive taxonomy of audio challenges. Our evaluation pitches 20 prospective challenges against a leading voice-cloning system. We have compiled a novel open-source challenge dataset with contributions from 100 smartphone and desktop users, yielding 18,600 original and 1.6 million deepfake samples. Through rigorous machine and human evaluations of this dataset, we achieved a deepfake detection rate of 86% and an 80% AUC score, respectively. Notably, utilizing a set of 11 challenges significantly enhances detection capabilities. Our findings reveal that combining human intuition with machine precision offers complementary advantages. Consequently, we have developed an innovative human-AI collaborative system that melds human discernment with algorithmic accuracy, boosting final joint accuracy to 82.9%. This system highlights the significant advantage of AI-assisted pre-screening in call verification processes. Samples can be heard at https://mittalgovind.github.io/autch-samples/
