An example method for training AI models for in-loop filters includes generating a training dataset by passing a video through a codec pipeline, extracting one or more predefined block features from the training dataset, creating a plurality of clusters based on the extracted one or more predefined block features from the training dataset, dividing the plurality of clusters into a sub-plurality of clusters based on the extracted one or more predefined block features and an intra-cluster variation threshold, and supplying the sub-plurality of clusters separately into a plurality of AI models based on the extracted one or more predefined block features.
