Pneumatic soft robots present many advantages in manipulation tasks. Notably, their inherent compliance makes them safe and reliable in unstructured and fragile environments. However, full-body shape sensing for pneumatic soft robots is challenging because of their high degrees of freedom and complex deformation behaviors. Vision-based proprioception sensing methods relying on embedded cameras and deep learning provide a good solution to proprioception sensing by extracting the full-body shape information from the high-dimensional sensing data. But the current training data collection process makes it difficult for many applications. To address this challenge, we propose and demonstrate a robust sim-to-real pipeline that allows the collection of the soft robot's shape information in high-fidelity point cloud representation. The model trained on simulated data was evaluated with real internal camera â€¦
