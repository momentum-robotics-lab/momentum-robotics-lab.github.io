Finding an occluded object in a lateral access environment such as a shelf or cabinet is a problem that arises in many contexts such as warehouses, retail, healthcare, shipping, and homes. While this problem, known as mechanical search, is well-studied in overhead access environments, lateral access environments introduce constraints on the poses of objects and on available grasp actions, and pushing actions are preferred to preserve the environment structure. We propose LAXRAY (Lateral Access maXimal Reduction in support Area of occupancY distribution): a system that combines target object occupancy distribution prediction with a mechanical search policy that sequentially pushes occluding objects to reveal a given target object. For scenarios with extruded polygonal objects, we introduce two lateral-access search policies that encode a history of predicted target distributions and can plan up to three â€¦
