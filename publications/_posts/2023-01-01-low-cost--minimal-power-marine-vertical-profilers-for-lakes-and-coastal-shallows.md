In this paper we present a new model for a lightweight and compact marine vertical profiler designed to enable agile, low-cost water column-profiling missions. The profiler is untethered, built from a cylindrical acrylic capsule, an onboard AVR microcontroller, and a configurable set of underwater sensors. Our portable profiler can be deployed and easily redeployed at multiple locations, enabling an individual researcher to quickly and efficiently sample water column parameters across a body of water. The profiler is light enough to be lowered by hand into a lake or reservoir and is also capable of multiple dives without retrieval. A researcher can configure a depth and a duration of time that the profiler will descend for. Additionally, researchers can take advantage of a new capability of the profiler our group calls Adaptive Sampling: at the conclusion of its descent, the profiler analyzes the water column parameters it â€¦
