The central theme in robotic manipulation is that of the robot interacting with the world through physical contact. We tend to describe that physical contact using specific words that capture the nature of the contact and the action, such as grasp, roll, pivot, push, pull, tilt, close, open etc. We refer to these situation-specific actions as manipulation primitives. Due to the nonlinear and nonsmooth nature of physical interaction, roboticists have devoted significant efforts towards studying individual manipulation primitives. However, studying individual primitives one by one is an inherently limited process, due engineering costs, overfitting to specific tasks, and lack of robustness to unforeseen variations. These limitations motivate the main contribution of this paper: a complete and general framework to autogenerate manipulation primitives. To do so, we develop the theory and computation of contact modes as a means to â€¦
